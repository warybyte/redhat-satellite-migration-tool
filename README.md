# redhat-satellite-migration-tool
A migration tool I wrote to migrate systems from RHN network (Satellite5) to RHSM network (Satellite6). I found nothing from RedHat to automate this process, especially when multiple platforms and activation keys were involved, so I wrote my own. I hope it can help others.
